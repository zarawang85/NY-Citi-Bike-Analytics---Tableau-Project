# NY-Citi-Bike-Analytics---Tableau-Project

Used Tableau to aggregate, model, analyze, and visualize the data of the largest bike sharing program in the United States. 

Based on the created visualizations several unexpected phenomena that would help improve the city program were found. 

Generated a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, maps, and insights for presenting to customers easily.
